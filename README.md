# Mystic oracle
**Mystic Oracle** is a quirky web project designed to practise combining random selection, personalised messages, and custom button animations. Users are asked to input their name and click a visually-enhanced button featuring an icon hover effect that stylishly takes over the text.

Once clicked, the oracle reveals a random, mysterious (and often ridiculous) fortune that includes the user's name in the message. For example:

_The next time you open an umbrella indoors, George, you will be instantly popular._

The oracle also provides five lucky numbers, each randomly selected between 1 and 99.

This project was a fun way to practise working with randomness, user input, DOM manipulation, and experimenting with playful UI animations.
